# Overview

Learn and understand Mobile App creation by creating a basic Calculator App.

In Android Studio, using Kotlin, I was able to write a basic Calculator App.    
I used Kotlin features of type inference "as" to declare variables.  
I used extension functions on the binding of the text views.  
I used 'when' in my calculateResults function to ensure proper logic.  


By writting this software I was able to gain experience with App building, and understanding the kotlin language.

# Future Work

For the future:

- Remember that having current versions of software will be different and not comparable to older tutorials.
- If project is unfixable after an hour of unsuccessful repair attempts, it may be best to start over completely.
- Remember that all complex things can be broken down into smaller functions, and that it is best to take the time and understand them individually.
